      I received a Master in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg">National University of Singapore</a> in 2020,
      as well as a Master in Software Engineering from
      <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home">Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). </a><br/>
      <p>
        My primary research interests lie in 3D geometry processing and its applications,
        ranging from physics-based simulation to animation.
        In the past, I have worked on several topics centered around discrete shape modelling,
        including mesh deformation using geometric energies, hexahedral meshing,
        or semantic mesh segmentation. I'm also interested in data science techniques and how they
        can be applied to 3D problems, such as machine learning & optimization, operations research,
        extended Kalman filtering, or dimensionality reduction.

      <h1>B-Mesh Modeller</h1>
      With two friends from Télécom Paris, we created a 3D modelling software based on a novel approach described in <a
        href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2009/3aea25b50e59c63998ba0377371c59bf007f.pdf">a research paper</a>.
      The idea is to create an initial mesh in only a few minutes by placing spheres in 3D to represent
      the skeleton of the modelled object. The user can freely create and customize the mesh. It can be
      modified in real-time.

      <h1>Aesthetic functions</h1>
      This is a fun little project to explore the artistic side of two-dimensional functions. All you have to do is
      enter a
      math function and play with the sliders to generate some stunning artworks.
      Any function works, no matter how complex, but even on simpler ones the results are often surprising.
      If you do try it out, please send me your creations!

      <h1>Cow Texture generator</h1>
      Ever felt the need to have an infinite supply of cow pattern textures ? <br /><br />

      This project was inspired by <a href="https://mgmalheiros.github.io/research/leopard/"><i>The leopard never
          changes
          its spots</i></a>, a SIGGRAPH 2020 paper by Malheiros, Marcelo de G. and Fensterseifer, Henrique and Walter,
      Marcelo. This paper uses a reaction-diffusion model to approximate
      tissue growth, and successfully generates a few 2D patterns matching real species. This project aims to adapt
      this model to generate cow patterns, which were not covered in the original article.

      <h1>Evaluation of a Spectral Data Transformation Method for Meaningful Mesh Segmentation</h1>
      I wanted to see if I could transform a 3D mesh in a weaningful way to make 3D segmentation easier.
      To evaluate this transformation, I used
      <a href="https://segeval.cs.princeton.edu/">this awesome dataset</a></li> which includes human-generated ground
      truth segmentations,
      and used simple clustering algorithms to generate a segmentation. By comparing results with the ground truth, I
      was able to measure the
      efficiency of this approach and identify the circumstances under which it's useful. For more detail, here is
      <a
        href="https://github.com/CorentinDumery/3DTransformation/blob/master/Evaluation%20of%20a%20Spectral%20Data%20Transformation%20Method%20for%20Meaningful%20Mesh%20Segmentation.pdf">a

      <h1>Design of Implants for Skull Reconstructive Surgery</h1>
      This project aims to make 3D skull implant generation as easy as possible. The idea is to input a mesh derived
      from a CT scan and use two edge loops
      to specify the part of the skull where an implant should be generated. The skull layer is then reconstructed to
      make a perfect-fit implant. Then, a
      flattening algorithm is used to flatten each layer of the implant to make it suitable for implant 3D printing.
      Cutting path are added to release some
      flattening constraints. This work was done for the National University of
      Singapore in collaboration with
      <a href="https://www.osteopore.com/">Osteopore</a></li>,
      and uses a patented software from NUS to reconstruct the outer layer of the skull using symmetry constraints.

      <h1>[FRENCH] Modélisation agricole et optimisation de la répartition des surfaces</h1>
      Here's a video I made when I was 19 showing the different steps in my research trying to optimize the area
      allocation of an agricultural exploitation. It's in French and quite simple since this was done very early during
      my studies, but if you have any questions I'd be more than willing to speak about it with you. It was a fun
      experience and I enjoyed the freedom that I was given on this project.<br /> <br />
