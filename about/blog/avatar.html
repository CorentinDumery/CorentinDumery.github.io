      <h1>Making a 3D Avatar</h1>

      After playing <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3623167214470921/">Puzzling Places</a> for a while
      and learning about <i>Structure From Motion</i> with
      <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/leegh/">Prof Lee Gim Hee at NUS</a>,
      I've taken an interest in photogrammetry, <i>i.e.</i> retrieving 3D shapes from a set of 2D pictures.
      It's a pretty complex process, because the program has to figure out by itself the exact locations
      from which each picture was taken. <br /> <br />
      It turns out today there's some amazing free software that
      takes care of the whole 3D reconstruction for you.
      <a href="https://alicevision.org/#meshroom">Meshroom</a> in particular lets you see the whole process unfold
      on its interface. Even before the computation is complete, you can check the correspondences and the
      estimated camera positions to make sure the intermediate steps are not completely off
      (<i>and sometimes they are</i>).

      After experimenting with cats and teapots, I thought
      I'd try to make a 3D avatar of myself so I could use it instead of a dull 2D profile picture.
      However, capturing one's face is especially challenging, because the subject must not move
      the slightest for the reconstruction to work well.

      </br>

      </br>

      The resulting textured mesh is alright. Meshroom seems to have totally missed the torso and the hair,
      but the face is recognizable and only <i>slightly</i> deformed. It also has over 300 thousand triangles,
      so we'll need to remesh that.
      </br></br>
      After removing all of the background, I sculpted myself some approximate hair in Blender and smoothed
      the mesh. It's still ridiculously refined in some spots, so we'll do
      some quick remeshing using <a href="https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes">Instant Meshes</a>
      to generate a regular and coarse triangle mesh.
      </br></br>
      The texture has some issues. Most importantly, the room lighting combined with my camera's parameters
      led to a strange white line and different shades on both cheeks.
      But before we actually get to it, it's really important to
      bake a new texture in Blender. Meshroom generates messy textures with tiny patches, which
      makes them very hard to edit.  Once this is done, we're able to photoshop away these white stains on the texture
      and fix the eyes.

      </br></br>
      The final texture is somewhat terrifying, but that was to be expected. I'm just glad the real me is in 3D.
      </br></br>

      </br>
      And for the final presentation, we'll export the UV coordinates and visualize the mesh
      in <a href="https://libigl.github.io/">libigl</a>:
      </br></br>

      <br/>

      The final result is pretty convincing. There's definitely a bit of an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">Uncanny Valley</a> feeling,
      which means it's quite a success, I guess.
