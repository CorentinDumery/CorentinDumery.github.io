      <h1>The non-existence of aliasing patterns</h1>

      <riddle>My kin is that of a mirage, invisible to lone humans,<br>
      standing on the fickle edge, of existence and illusions.<br><br>
      I can never be lonely, for I am a reinterpretation, <br>
      merely a new body, born from another creation.<br><br>
      I am the utter nonsense, the artefact that you see, <br>
      the uncanny consequence, of your sampling frequency. <br><br>
      What am I ?</riddle>

      Hover to see the answer : <hidden>An aliasing pattern! (It was in the title!)
      </hidden><br><br>

      Now either you got the answer right, or you're just confused.

      Say we have a spiral, for example. Such as the one below, which, in
      <a href="../../index.html#aesthetic_article">aesthetic-functions</a>
      syntax, is written using the following formula:
      <img class="formula" src="../../images/blog/formula_spiral.png">

      From there, let us consider the set of pixels (i,j) such that:
      <img class="formula" src="../../images/blog/spiral_area.png">

      Where width is a parameter between 0 and 255. This formula yields the following:

      <img class="illustration" src="../../images/blog/spiral.png">

      Notice how the lines are getting closer and closer as they get
      further away from the center. Eventually, the gap between two consecutive lines
      will be less than a pixel. So if we zoom out, what will we see ?
      Apart from the center, the spiral will not be visible anymore,
      yet pixels will show <i>something</i>. Something that might not
      look like the spiral, but should still be somewhat related to it.<br/><br/>
      Here's the result:
      <br />
      <img class="illustration" src="../../images/blog/alias_static.gif">

      That's our aliasing pattern. A completely new figure that has close to nothing
      to do with the original spiral, yet is a represensation
      of the exact same thing.
      In <a href="../../index.html#aesthetic_article">aesthetic-functions</a>,
      each pixel evaluates the spiral function in it's top left corner,
      which is equivalent to a 2D sub-sampling of the <i>real</i> spiral.
      <br/><br/>
      In signal processing, it is well understood that undersampling a signal will lead
      to artifacts. As a general rule, the signal should not contain information
      at more than half the sampling frequency.


      <a href="https://matthews.sites.wfu.edu/misc/DigPhotog/alias/">This picture</a> illustrates why:

      <img width="50%" style="display:block; margin:auto; padding:0.8em;" src="../../images/blog/sampling.png">

      Undersampling a sine wave results in another sine wave with a completely different frequency.
      Thanksfully, our spiral is a bit more complicated than a sine wave,
      which explains why our aliasing looks so strange. It makes it pretty hard
      to predict what shape the aliasing pattern will be, which totally
      contributes to how fascinating these can be. Let us play with our
      spiral a bit, and see how it evolves:

      <img class="illustration" src="../../images/blog/alias_rotating.gif">

      Hypnotic! When we zoom in onto a corner, it seems completely unrelated
      to our spiral. Even more surprisingly perhaps, the pattern repeats faster
      than the spiral rotates:

      <img class="pixel_art" src="../../images/blog/cropped_alias.gif">

      The undersampling phenomenon is heavily dependant on the sampling frequency.
      In our case, if we play with the resolution, we're effectively changing
      the sampling frequency. Quite interestingly, when we do just that on
      our spiral, we get the same pattern but with varying size:

      <img class="illustration" src="../../images/blog/alias_resolution.gif">

      So remember, when visualizing something, the strangest things can sometimes
      happen. If a slight variation in the input leads to a very different
      visualization, you might not be seeing what you're trying to see.<br/><br/>
      Anti-aliasing can easily be implemented by sampling multiple times per pixel,
      and it could be done in aesthetic-functions. But wouldn't that be a shame ?
      These patterns add complexity and make seemingly simple figures surprisingly
      unpredictable.
