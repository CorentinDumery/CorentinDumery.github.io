      <h1>Making a 3D Avatar</h1>

      After playing <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3623167214470921/">Puzzling Places</a> for a while
      and learning about <i>Structure From Motion</i> with 
      <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/leegh/">Prof Lee Gim Hee at NUS</a>,
      I've taken an interest in photogrammetry, <i>i.e.</i> retrieving 3D shapes from a set of 2D pictures. 
      It's a pretty complex process, because the program has to figure out by itself the exact locations 
      from which each picture was taken. <br /> <br />
      It turns out today there's some amazing free software that 
      takes care of the whole 3D reconstruction for you. 
      <a href="https://alicevision.org/#meshroom">Meshroom</a> in particular lets you see the whole process unfold 
      on its interface. Even before the computation is complete, you can check the correspondences and the 
      estimated camera positions to make sure the intermediate steps are not completely off 
      (<i>and sometimes they are</i>).  

      <img class="centered_pic" src="../images/blog/meshroom_sfm.png" width="100%">
      <br />

      After experimenting with cats and teapots, I thought
      I'd try to make a 3D avatar of myself so I could use it instead of a dull 2D profile picture.
      However, capturing one's face is especially challenging, because the subject must not move
      the slightest for the reconstruction to work well.

      </br>
      <img class="centered_pic" src="../images/blog/meshroom.png" width="100%">
      </br>

      The resulting textured mesh is alright. Meshroom seems to have totally missed the torso and the hair,
      but the face is recognizable and only <i>slightly</i> deformed. It also has over 300 thousand triangles,
      so we'll need to remesh that.
      </br></br>
      After removing all of the background, I sculpted myself some approximate hair in Blender and smoothed 
      the mesh. It's still ridiculously refined in some spots, so we'll do 
      some quick remeshing using <a href="https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes">Instant Meshes</a>
      to generate a regular and coarse triangle mesh. 
      </br></br>
      The texture has some issues. Most importantly, the room lighting combined with my camera's parameters
      led to a strange white line and different shades on both cheeks. 
      But before we actually get to it, it's really important to
      bake a new texture in Blender. Meshroom generates messy textures with tiny patches, which
      makes them very hard to edit.  Once this is done, we're able to photoshop away these white stains on the texture
      and fix the eyes.

      </br></br>
      The final texture is somewhat terrifying, but that was to be expected. I'm just glad the real me is in 3D.
      </br></br>
      <img class="centered_pic" src="../images/blog/self_tex.png" width="40%">
      </br>
      And for the final presentation, we'll export the UV coordinates and visualize the mesh
      in <a href="https://libigl.github.io/">libigl</a>:
      </br></br>
      <img id="photo_self" width="40%" class="centered_pic" src="../images/blog/photogrammetry_self.gif">
      <br/> 

      The final result is pretty convincing. There's definitely a bit of an 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">Uncanny Valley</a> feeling,
      which means it's quite a success, I guess. 
      If you want to make your own avatar, here are two videos I'd recommend to get started quickly:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D0EhSi-vvc">this one covering the basics of meshroom and photogrammetry</a>,
      and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUVeV0wsH8">this one on how to clean-up your mesh and bake a new texture</a>.

      <h1>The non-existence of aliasing patterns</h1>

      <riddle>My kin is that of a mirage, invisible to lone humans,<br>
      standing on the fickle edge, of existence and illusions.<br><br>
      I can never be lonely, for I am a reinterpretation, <br>
      merely a new body, born from another creation.<br><br>
      I am the utter nonsense, the artefact that you see, <br>
      the uncanny consequence, of your sampling frequency. <br><br>
      What am I ?</riddle>
      
      Hover to see the answer : <hidden>An aliasing pattern ! (It was in the title !)
      </hidden><br><br>

      Now either you got the answer right, or you're just confused.
      
      Say we have a spiral, for example. Such as the one below, which, in 
      <a href="../index.html#aesthetic_article">aesthetic-functions</a>
      syntax, is written using the following formula:
      <img class="formula" src="../images/blog/formula_spiral.png"> 

      From there, let us consider the set of pixels (i,j) such that:
      <img class="formula" src="../images/blog/spiral_area.png"> 

      Where width is a parameter between 0 and 255. This formula yields the following:

      <img class="illustration" src="../images/blog/spiral.png"> 

      Notice how the lines are getting closer and closer as they get 
      further away from the center. Eventually, the gap between two consecutive lines
      will be less than a pixel. So if we zoom out, what will we see ? 
      Apart from the center, the spiral will not be visible anymore, 
      yet pixels will show <i>something</i>. Something that might not
      look like the spiral, but should still be somewhat related to it.<br/><br/>
      Here's the result:
      <br />
      <img class="illustration" src="../images/blog/alias_static.gif">

      That's our aliasing pattern. A completely new figure that has close to nothing 
      to do with the original spiral, yet is a represensation
      of the exact same thing. 
      In <a href="../index.html#aesthetic_article">aesthetic-functions</a>, 
      each pixel evaluates the spiral function in it's top left corner, 
      which is equivalent to a 2D sub-sampling of the <i>real</i> spiral.
      <br/><br/>
      In signal processing, it is well understood that undersampling a signal will lead
      to artifacts. As a general rule, the signal should not contain information 
      at more than half the sampling frequency. 


      <a href="https://matthews.sites.wfu.edu/misc/DigPhotog/alias/">This picture</a> illustrates why:

      <img width="50%" style="display:block; margin:auto; padding:0.8em;" src="../images/blog/sampling.png">

      Undersampling a sine wave results in another sine wave with a completely different frequency.
      Thanksfully, our spiral is a bit more complicated than a sine wave,
      which explains why our aliasing looks so strange. It makes it pretty hard 
      to predict what shape the aliasing pattern will be, which totally
      contributes to how fascinating these can be. Let us play with our
      spiral a bit, and see how it evolves:

      <img class="illustration" src="../images/blog/alias_rotating.gif">

      Hypnotic ! When we zoom in onto a corner, it seems completely unrelated
      to our spiral. Even more surprisingly perhaps, the pattern repeats faster
      than the spiral rotates:

      <img class="pixel_art" src="../images/blog/cropped_alias.gif">

      The undersampling phenomenon is heavily dependant on the sampling frequency.
      In our case, if we play with the resolution, we're effectively changing
      the sampling frequency. Quite interestingly, when we do just that on
      our spiral, we get the same pattern but with varying size:
      
      <img class="illustration" src="../images/blog/alias_resolution.gif">

      So remember, when visualizing something, the strangest things can sometimes 
      happen. If a slight variation in the input leads to a very different 
      visualization, you might not be seeing what you're trying to see.<br/><br/>
      Anti-aliasing can easily be implemented by sampling multiple times per pixel, 
      and it could be done in aesthetic-functions. But wouldn't that be a shame ?
      These patterns add complexity and make seemingly simple figures surprisingly
      unpredictable.
