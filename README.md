## Welcome to my website !
My name is Corentin Dumery and I am currently studying at Telecom ParisTech. More precisely, I'm attending 3D graphics and theoretical computer science courses.
My interests include computers, video games, science, writing, life, the universe, and everything. This page is the place where I'm having fun learning web development on my free time.
You will find information about me, what I like, and nonsense that was born from my curiosity as I learned HTML/CSS/JS.
